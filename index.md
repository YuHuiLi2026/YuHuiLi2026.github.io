### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    I think Lab 7, part 2 is my favorite code throughout the 12 lab. Although it was the code that took the longest time for me to solve, it led me to understand what the relationship between different functions looks like and what is the reason, as a programmer, to use different functions in a project. I really enjoyed the moment when I eventually solve the ACE count part in the code and it was at the same time that made me start to find the beauty of the code by creating numerous different things and connecting them to create a “cyber living creature”  in the end
