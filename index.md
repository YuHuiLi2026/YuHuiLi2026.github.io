### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    I think Lab 7, part 2 is my favorite code throughout the 12 lab. Although it was the code that took the longest time for me to solve, it led me to understand what the relationship between different functions looks like and what is the reason, as a programmer, to use different functions in a project. I really enjoyed the moment when I eventually solve the ACE count part in the code and it was at the same time that made me start to find the beauty of the code by creating numerous different things and connecting them to create a “cyber living creature”  in the end"

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 is also one of my favorite code projects. It was the first time I found out how to use code to interact with a CSV file that stores numerous data information. By using different loops and functions to loop through the 2D vectors, I think this part of the code provided really good practice for future data structure and data analysis. Using separate header and function files, this part of the code also gave me a more comprehensive understanding of what is the format of the codes that we are going to learn next semester will look like.
    
* Lab 6

    Finally, Lab 6 part 2 is another interesting code for me. It was the first time I know what is the function of boolean function and how to properly use them. At the same time, it was the first lab that I helped other student to understand what the code should be look like and what are some logical thinking student should use to solve this problem. Besides,this code helped me to better understand how does complex if-else statement work.
